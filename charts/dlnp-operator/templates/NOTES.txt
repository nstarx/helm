Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

The DLNP Operator has been deployed to your cluster.

The operator is now watching for Kubeconfig custom resources in the {{ .Values.operator.watchNamespace }} namespace.

To create a Kubeconfig resource and deploy Kubeflow to a target cluster:

1. Create a file named kubeconfig-sample.yaml with the following content:

apiVersion: nstarx.com/v1alpha1
kind: Kubeconfig
metadata:
  name: TARGET-CLUSTER-NAME
spec:
  cloud: aws  # or azure, gcp, etc.
  kubeconfig: |
    # Paste your kubeconfig content here

2. Apply it to your cluster:

   kubectl apply -f kubeconfig-sample.yaml

3. Check the status of your resource:

   kubectl get kubeconfig TARGET-CLUSTER-NAME -o yaml

The operator will automatically:
- Process the kubeconfig
- Validate connectivity to the target cluster
- Deploy Kubeflow to the target cluster
- Update the status of the Kubeconfig resource
